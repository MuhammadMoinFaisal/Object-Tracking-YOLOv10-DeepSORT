# Roboflow 100 Dataset

Roboflow 100, developed by [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) and sponsored by Intel, is a groundbreaking [object detection](../../tasks/detect.md) benchmark. It includes 100 diverse datasets sampled from over 90,000 public datasets. This benchmark is designed to test the adaptability of models to various domains, including healthcare, aerial imagery, and video games.

</p>

## Key Features

- Includes 100 datasets across seven domains: Aerial, Video games, Microscopic, Underwater, Documents, Electromagnetic, and Real World.
- The benchmark comprises 224,714 images across 805 classes, thanks to over 11,170 hours of labeling efforts.
- All images are resized to 640x640 pixels, with a focus on eliminating class ambiguity and filtering out underrepresented classes.
- Annotations include bounding boxes for objects, making it suitable for [training](../../modes/train.md) and evaluating object detection models.

## Dataset Structure

The Roboflow 100 dataset is organized into seven categories, each with a distinct set of datasets, images, and classes:

- **Aerial**: Consists of 7 datasets with a total of 9,683 images, covering 24 distinct classes.
- **Video Games**: Includes 7 datasets, featuring 11,579 images across 88 classes.
- **Microscopic**: Comprises 11 datasets with 13,378 images, spanning 28 classes.
- **Underwater**: Contains 5 datasets, encompassing 18,003 images in 39 classes.
- **Documents**: Consists of 8 datasets with 24,813 images, divided into 90 classes.
- **Electromagnetic**: Made up of 12 datasets, totaling 36,381 images in 41 classes.
- **Real World**: The largest category with 50 datasets, offering 110,615 images across 495 classes.

This structure enables a diverse and extensive testing ground for object detection models, reflecting real-world application scenarios.

## Applications

Roboflow 100 is invaluable for various applications related to computer vision and deep learning. Researchers and engineers can use this benchmark to:

- Evaluate the performance of object detection models in a multi-domain context.
