# Roboflow Universe Carparts Segmentation Dataset

The [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) [Carparts Segmentation Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/gianmarco-russo-vt9xr/car-seg-un1pm) is a curated collection of images and videos designed for computer vision applications, specifically focusing on segmentation tasks related to car parts. This dataset provides a diverse set of visuals captured from multiple perspectives, offering valuable annotated examples for training and testing segmentation models.

Whether you're working on automotive research, developing AI solutions for vehicle maintenance, or exploring computer vision applications, the Carparts Segmentation Dataset serves as a valuable resource for enhancing accuracy and efficiency in your projects.

## Dataset Structure

The data distribution within the Carparts Segmentation Dataset is organized as outlined below:

- **Training set**: Includes 3156 images, each accompanied by its corresponding annotations.
- **Testing set**: Comprises 276 images, with each one paired with its respective annotations.
- **Validation set**: Consists of 401 images, each having corresponding annotations.

## Applications

Carparts Segmentation finds applications in automotive quality control, auto repair, e-commerce cataloging, traffic monitoring, autonomous vehicles, insurance processing, recycling, and smart city initiatives. It streamlines processes by accurately identifying and categorizing different vehicle components, contributing to efficiency and automation in various industries.

## Dataset YAML

A YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) file is used to define the dataset configuration. It contains information about the dataset's paths, classes, and other relevant information. In the case of the Package Segmentation dataset, the `carparts-seg.yaml` file is maintained at [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/carparts-seg.yaml](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/carparts-seg.yaml).

!!! Example "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/carparts-seg.yaml"

    ```yaml
    --8<-- "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/carparts-seg.yaml"
    ```

## Usage

To train Ultralytics YOLOv8n model on the Carparts Segmentation dataset for 100 epochs with an image size of 640, you can use the following code snippets. For a comprehensive list of available arguments, refer to the model [Training](../../modes/train.md) page.

!!! Example "Train Example"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO('yolov8n-seg.pt')  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

        # Train the model
        results = model.train(data='carparts-seg.yaml', epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Start training from a pretrained *.pt model
        yolo segment train data=carparts-seg.yaml model=yolov8n-seg.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```
