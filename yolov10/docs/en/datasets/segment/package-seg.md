# Roboflow Universe Package Segmentation Dataset

The [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) [Package Segmentation Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/factorypackage/factory_package) is a curated collection of images specifically tailored for tasks related to package segmentation in the field of computer vision. This dataset is designed to assist researchers, developers, and enthusiasts working on projects related to package identification, sorting, and handling.

Containing a diverse set of images showcasing various packages in different contexts and environments, the dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating segmentation models. Whether you are engaged in logistics, warehouse automation, or any application requiring precise package analysis, the Package Segmentation Dataset provides a targeted and comprehensive set of images to enhance the performance of your computer vision algorithms.

## Dataset Structure

The distribution of data in the Package Segmentation Dataset is structured as follows:

- **Training set**: Encompasses 1920 images accompanied by their corresponding annotations.
- **Testing set**: Consists of 89 images, each paired with its respective annotations.
- **Validation set**: Comprises 188 images, each with corresponding annotations.

## Applications

Package segmentation, facilitated by the Package Segmentation Dataset, is crucial for optimizing logistics, enhancing last-mile delivery, improving manufacturing quality control, and contributing to smart city solutions. From e-commerce to security applications, this dataset is a key resource, fostering innovation in computer vision for diverse and efficient package analysis applications.

## Dataset YAML

A YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) file is used to define the dataset configuration. It contains information about the dataset's paths, classes, and other relevant information. In the case of the Package Segmentation dataset, the `package-seg.yaml` file is maintained at [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/package-seg.yaml](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/package-seg.yaml).

!!! Example "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/package-seg.yaml"

    ```yaml
    --8<-- "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/package-seg.yaml"
    ```

## Usage

To train Ultralytics YOLOv8n model on the Package Segmentation dataset for 100 epochs with an image size of 640, you can use the following code snippets. For a comprehensive list of available arguments, refer to the model [Training](../../modes/train.md) page.

!!! Example "Train Example"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO('yolov8n-seg.pt')  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

        # Train the model
        results = model.train(data='package-seg.yaml', epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Start training from a pretrained *.pt model
        yolo segment train data=package-seg.yaml model=yolov8n-seg.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```
